# Morkow-Switching-Multifractal-Volatility-Model
The model represents asset volatility as a latent regime-dependent process, where volatility evolves according to a persistent Markov chain with multiple states, each associated with a distinct volatility level. Regime probabilities are updated sequentially using Bayesian filtering based on the observed returns.
